        <p>Corfu is a vibrant island in the Ionian Sea, off the northwest coast of Greece. Known for its Venetian architecture, turquoise waters, and charming old town (a UNESCO World Heritage Site), Corfu blends natural beauty with rich history. Olive groves blanket the hills, while hidden beaches and lively villages invite exploration. It's a perfect mix of culture, relaxation, and Mediterranean charm.</p>

        <p>Paleokastritsa, Sidari, and Barbati Beach each showcase a different side of Corfu’s coastal charm. Up north, Sidari draws visitors with its striking sandstone formations, including the famous Canal d’Amour, steeped in romantic legend and natural wonder. On the island’s east coast, Barbati Beach offers a more tranquil escape, with its white pebbles, crystal-clear waters, ideal for swimming, sunbathing, and enjoying peaceful seaside moments.</p>
    </div>
    <p>Tucked away on the island’s northwest coast, Paleokastritsa isn’t just one of Corfu’s most beautiful
        destinations—it’s one of the most enchanting spots in all of Greece.</p>
    <p>Paleokastritsa is best known for its string of sheltered bays and impossibly clear waters that shift between sapphire, teal, and deep azure depending on the light. These beaches are perfect for swimming, snorkeling, or simply floating while surrounded by towering green cliffs. You’ll find sunbeds and tavernas at some, while others feel wild and untouched.</p>
    <p>One of the best ways to explore Paleokastritsa is by boat. You can rent a small self-drive boat or hop on a guided tour to discover hidden caves like the famous Blue Eye Cave, and tiny beaches only accessible from the sea. Don’t forget your snorkel gear—underwater, it’s just as magical.</p>

        <p>The capital of Corfu Island, Corfu Town (or Kerkyra in Greek), is not just a jumping-off point for beach adventures—it’s a UNESCO World Heritage Site that deserves its own spotlight. It’s a place where pastel-colored buildings, cobbled alleys, and grand fortresses tell stories of empires and elegance, all set against the shimmering Ionian Sea.</p>
        <p>The beating heart of Corfu Town is its Old Town, a maze of narrow lanes called kantounia that twist beneath wrought-iron balconies and flowering bougainvillaea. Here, you’ll find hidden cafes, boutique shops, and locals hanging out in shaded courtyards as they have for centuries.
            There’s a distinctly Venetian feel to the architecture, thanks to centuries of rule by the Republic of Venice. But look closer and you’ll spot French arcades, British neoclassical buildings, and Greek Orthodox churches—a beautiful patchwork of cultures layered over time.</p>

        <p>One of the most elegant spots in town is The Liston, a beautiful arched promenade inspired by the Rue de Rivoli in Paris. It borders Spianada Square, the largest square in Greece, where people gather for festivals, cricket matches (a leftover from British rule), or a simple evening stroll.</p>

        <p>Corfu Town is flanked by two massive fortresses: the Old Fortress to the east, with jaw-dropping views over the sea, and the New Fortress, a Venetian-built citadel that towers over the rooftops. Both are worth exploring if you’re into history—or just want the best Instagram shots of the city.</p>
    </div>
    <p>Don’t leave without stepping into a few of Corfu Town’s museums, like the Archaeological Museum, the Museum of Asian Art, or the Byzantine Museum housed in a former church. Each offers a slice of the island’s rich and varied history.
        Then there’s the food. From traditional pastitsada (slow-cooked beef in tomato and spice) to fresh seafood and creamy kumquat liqueur, Corfu Town is a feast for the senses. Try a seaside taverna or duck into a hidden garden restaurant—you really can’t go wrong.</p>
