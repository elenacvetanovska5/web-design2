        <p>Paris, the City of Light, is a place where history, art, and romance meet on every corner. From the banks of the Seine River to the grand boulevards and quiet backstreets, Paris is a city that invites exploration and rewards curiosity.</p>
        <p>Rising gracefully above the city, the Eiffel Tower is Paris’s most iconic landmark—a lattice of iron that seems to float against the sky. By day it sparkles in the sunlight; by night it shimmers with thousands of lights, casting reflections on the waters of the Seine below.

            The Seine River, winding through the heart of Paris, is the city’s soul. Strolling its banks or cruising beneath its historic bridges offers one of the most magical views of the Eiffel Tower—standing tall, timeless, and forever Parisian.</p>

        <p>Paris is a city of layers—where every street corner holds a piece of history, and every view feels like a painting. From the gothic towers of Notre-Dame to the modern edge of La Défense, Paris blends the old and the new with effortless elegance. The city's neighborhoods, or arrondissements, each have their own personality—whether it’s the artistic soul of Montmartre, the intellectual quiet of the Latin Quarter, or the chic energy of the Marais.</p>
        <p>And just beyond the city, a short journey leads to Versailles—a dazzling reminder of royal France. The Palace of Versailles, with its endless gardens, gilded rooms, and the breathtaking Hall of Mirrors, reflects the grandeur of a monarchy that once ruled from its golden halls. Though removed from the bustle of Paris, Versailles feels like an extension of its spirit—majestic, artistic, and endlessly captivating.</p>
